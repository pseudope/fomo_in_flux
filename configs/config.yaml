########################## General Parameters
### Verbosity
# If set to 0, will reduce print-outputs.
verbosity: 1

# If set, will not perform any training, and only evaluate zero-shot performances.
zeroshot_only: False
### Devices to utilize.
gpu: [0]


########################## Continual Learning Experiment Parameters.
experiment:
  ### Type of experiment to run.
  # Options are: 'class_incremental', 'mixed_batch'
  # class_incremental: standard CL setup, with standard class-separated tasks.
  # mixed_batch: streaming setup in which each batch can contain arbitrary samples from any possible dataset.
  type: 'class_incremental'

  ### For experiment.type=mixed_batch:
  # How samples should be sampled ('uniform', 'balanced').
  # uniform: Fill minibatch with samples from each datasets uniformly.
  # balanced: Sample from each dataset weighted by dataset size.
  mix_mode: 'uniform'
  # How many artificial tasks (think of as pseudo-epochs) should the stream be divided into.
  mix_tasks: 100

  ### Type of Open-Vocabulary Training.
  # Modes:
  # [Q] Determine mode based on loss function / vice-versa?
  # contrastive:
  #     > standard open-vocabulary training, where one only contrasts concept appearing in a minibatch.
  # classification_seen:
  #     > Classification-style training, where concepts/classes are only contrasted against once the specific task has been seen.
  # classification_task:
  #     > Commonly leveraged in adaptation- or prompt-based CL. Only contrasts against logits associated with classes in the current task.
  # classification_dataset:
  #     > For normal continual learning on a single dataset. Assumes access to all streaming classes at once.
  #     > Is equal to classification_default in the standard single-dataset CL setup.
  #     > For multi-dataset CL, during training, we mask out all non-task-dataset logits.
  # classification_default:
  #     > For normal continual learning on a single dataset. Assumes access to all streaming classes at once.
  #     > When deployed on CL with data from multiple datasets, during each task, we still generate logits for ALL classes across all datasets.
